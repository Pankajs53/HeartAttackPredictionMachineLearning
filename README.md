# Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a Python script for predicting heart disease using logistic regression and evaluating the model's performance.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict heart disease based on a dataset with various health-related features. The script preprocesses the data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.

# Dataset
The dataset contains health-related attributes of patients, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

The target variable (target) indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

# Requirements
Python 3.x , scikit-learn , pandas
You can install the required packages using:
```
pip install scikit-learn pandas
```

Ensure you have the dataset (df) loaded in your environment. This script assumes df is a pandas DataFrame containing the dataset.
